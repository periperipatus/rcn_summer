# Required Software
All commandline software required for this tutorial is installed on the ngsclass login of the class server. 
Please install one of the following GUIs for alignment viewing. 
* MEGA (free, all platforms https://www.megasoftware.net/) 
* Geneious (the free version is more restrictive but you can view alignments and perform translation)

If you want to run this on your personal computer, the necessary commandline tools are
* EMBOSS (http://emboss.open-bio.org/)
* BLAST+
* clustal omega
